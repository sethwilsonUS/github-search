# Simple GitHub User Search

This little tool uses JavaScript and JSON data from GitHub's API to display GitHub users and their top 5 repos. The app uses BootStrap 4 for styling.

## Usage

To use the app, rename `secret_example.js` to `secret.js` and replace the `gh_client_id` and `gh_client_secret` fields with your own GitHub API keys, which you can find in your GitHub profile settings.

Then, just start typing a GitHub username, and real-time results will automatically display.
